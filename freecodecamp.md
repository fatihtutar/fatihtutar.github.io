1.Comment Your JavaScript Code

```JavaScript
// this is one line comment
/*this is multiline comment
  no I did not copy paste from the left of the page:) */
  ```
  
2.Declare JavaScript Variables

```JavaScript
//Declare myName below this line
var myName;
```

3.Storing Values with the Assignment Operator

  Note:Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.
  
  - Assign the value 7 to variable a.
  - Assign the contents of a to variable b
```JavaScript
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
a = 7;
b =a;
```

4.Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

  Note:It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line
  
  - Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9
```JavaScript
// Example
var ourVar = 19;
// Only change code below this line
var a = 9;
```

5.Understanding Uninitialized Variables

  Note:When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".
  
  -Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.
```JavaScript
// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";
// Do not change code below this line
a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
```

6.Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables

Note:Best Practice-Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

  -Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.
Do not create any new variables.
```JavaScript
// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
```
