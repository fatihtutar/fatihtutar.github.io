Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
  - Assign the value 7 to variable a.
  - Assign the contents of a to variable b
  Note:Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.
```JavaScript
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
a = 7;
b =a;
```
